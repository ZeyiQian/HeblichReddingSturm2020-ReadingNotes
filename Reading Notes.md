### Description
Using newly constructed spatially disaggregated data for London from 1801 to 1921, 
we show that the invention of the steam railway led to the first large-scale separation of workplace and residence. 
We show that a class of quantitative urban models is remarkably successful in explaining this reorganization of economic ac- tivity. 
We structurally estimate one of the models in this class and find substantial agglomeration forces in both production and residence. 
In counterfactuals, we find that removing the whole railway network reduces the population and the value of land and buildings 
in London by up to 51.5% and 53.3% respectively, and decreases net commuting into the historical center of London by more than 300,000 workers.


## Reading Notes
### Introduction

##### Motivation：Huge commuting flows   vs.   Little knowledge about it's role in sustaining dense concentrations of economic activity
###### 1.Impose substantial real resource costs in terms of time spent commuting and the construction of large networks of complex transportation infrastructure. 
###### 2.Create commercial and residential areas, with their distinctive characteristics for production and consumption.

##### Historical events：Steam railways created in the mid-19th century

##### Evidence for the positive effect of residential separation on agglomeration
###### 1.Data set for Greater London during 1801-1921
###### 2.Spatial model
